This project implements image super-resolution using PyTorch — a deep learning approach to enhance image quality by increasing spatial resolution.


Super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input, restoring fine details and textures that are lost during downsampling. This technique is widely used in photography, video restoration, satellite imaging, and medical imaging.

  -Features

 Converts low-resolution images into detailed, high-resolution outputs

 Based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

 Fully implemented in PyTorch for flexibility and performance
